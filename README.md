# Scripts
Scripts I made in my free time, they are mostly in bash or python. 

MountDrive.sh - Bash Script made to mount any drive on your linux system. It was made on Parrot OS with default packages. 

PythonReady.sh - Bash Script made for me to get ready to learn python, which is why on line 133 there is a netacad web address. The only difference between this one and MountDrive.sh, is the last 13 lines that launch programs.
